# Preliminary Information {.unnumbered}

This is an artificial book to demonstrate the look of the [RapidBook Template](https://github.com/jxareas/RapidBook), which is a template to rapidly deploy either Python or R based books using Bookdown.

As this uses R Markdown, Python must be used through the `reticulate` interface.
